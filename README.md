# Dino-Jump-Game
Logisim code for emulating Dino Jump Game for project done on January 2023. The aim of this project is to employ the Digital System Design fundamentals and use it to create an enjoyable mini game that tests a playerâ€™s sense of timing and reflex. Mini games like these are often great ways for children to train and develop their sense of timing along with hand-eye coordination.
